# tauri-dir-tree-struct

A playground to create a directory tree structure using Tauri (WIP). Written in TypeScript and Rust.

Mainly intended to be used in [Iris](https://github.com/alexwkleung/Iris) as a rewrite for the file directory tree.

The outcome of this repo can be used for your own projects that need a local file directory tree. Be aware of the limitations out of the box if applicable.

A release will be made once it's ready.
