# tauri-dir-tree-struct

An isolated playground to create a directory tree structure using Tauri (WIP).

Mainly intended to be used in [Iris](https://github.com/alexwkleung/Iris) as a rewrite for the file directory tree.

The outcome of this repo can be used for your own projects that need a working file directory tree. A release will be made once it's ready.
